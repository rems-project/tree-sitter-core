* Project TODO list
** Do not skip comments
   they are now skipped via ~extra~
** Enable and parse line numbers
   Re-run Cerberus to generate C line numbers
   annotations in the generated Core and parse them
** Tokens for literals
   Why adding ~token~ around ~choice~ in ~ctor~ breaks parsing?
** Set up syntax highlighting rules
** Opaque tokens
   Review and make some AST nodes like Ctype opaque.
   We do not need a detailed structure for them.
   (see ~inline~ directive)
** emacs mode
   try to build emacs mode for Core based on this.
