* Project TODO list
** Tokens for literals
   Why adding ~token~ around ~choice~ in ~ctor~ breaks parsing?
** Set up syntax highlighting rules
** Opaque tokens
   Review and make some AST nodes like Ctype opaque.
   We do not need a detailed structure for them.
   (see ~inline~ directive)
** emacs mode
   try to build emacs mode for Core based on this.
** misc
   Highlight ~conv_int~, and other additional builtin functions.
   Also cheri-builtins.
** Parse location and annotations comments `{-# ... #-}`
** Solve `is_[un]signed` conflict issue (and similar)
